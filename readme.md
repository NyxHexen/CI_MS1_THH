## Introduction, Inception & Purpose

### __*The Bar*__
An all-inclusive fantasy-themed community-oriented computer lab & bar in Cardiff where people can relax, work, or study, while enjoying a coffee, cocktail, snacks & finger food. Events are hosted regularly where customers are invited to participate in monthly hackathons & competitive video games, along regular events such as hosting meet-ups and themed nights.

### __*The Website*__
For The Hexen Hut, I wanted to create something that does not necessarily conform to the more mainstream layouts and styles used, while staying true to the principles of UXD in keeping the website intuitive, simple and enjoyable to use.

-   Evolved to (if applicable): N/A

#### Design Concept:
-   Full screen landing page emulating start screen of a video game.
-   Header & Footer shared (except landing page)
-   Simulate 3D feeling by using shadows and section layering
-   Due to specificity of website theme, instead of background images we're using a gradient consisting of the dark & light colors, while making sure elements using light & dark do not get lost. Gradient - bottom-left to top-right;
-   Information is presented on medium-opacity light & dark card-style containers.
