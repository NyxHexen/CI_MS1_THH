### Design

My idea for the design was to create a simple, clean website with an 8-bit feel. Think Square Enix does Minecraft.

#### Color Scheme

<img src="docs/design/color-palette-thh.png" width="300">

#### Typography
The **fallback font** chosen across the website is 'sans-serif' for it's accessibility.

My **logo and h1-h3 headings** font is Press Start 2P from Google Fonts. I chose this font because it is an 8-bit style, bulky, font which fit into the theme of the bar.

My **h4+ headings and body** font is Play, also from Google Fonts. The font is more angular which compliments the 8-bit style font.

#### Images
Images across the website are sourced through Unsplash and a couple of Google searches. The sources have been listed below.

## 3. Features
[`Back To Top`](#table-of-contents)

The website consists of 5 responsive pages with 2 to 3 features per page.

Each page has 2 to 3 layout shifts across the 3 types of devices.

### Features at release

### index.html - Landing Page

Landing page has it's own separate stylesheet as the page consists of only header and footer elements. While footer remains the same across all devices, I wanted to house this header style separate from the rest.

I kept the landing page as simple and as clean as possible, so the customer gets a feel for what the website is about. This is the only page where the slogan can be found as it's one of only 3 things the customer sees upon visiting and it describes what the venue is about. A gaming bar.

The landing page consists of 2 main features:
<details>
<summary> 1. Full screen header </summary>

<img src="docs/features/feature-full-screen-header.png">
</details>

<details>
<summary> 2. Footer </summary>

<img src="docs/features/feature-footer.png">
</details>

The full screen header consists of 3 sections:
1. Logo - I wanted to keep things simple, so the logo is made up of an anchor (to allow use as navigation button) within an h1 element. The `h1` allowed the logo to also naturally respond to any view width changes. The logo has an infinite bounce keyframe animation inspired by the behavior of the game title in some video games. 

<details>
<summary> Supporting Image </summary>
<img src="docs/features/feature-logo.png">
</details>

2. Slogan - A standard `h2`, describing the bar's theme and purpose. It took a bit of time to style it the way it looks now. I wanted it to stand out, which is why I chose the color black for the text, but that created some issue with readability and contrast which I resolved by adding two layers of shadow in different color.

_User Story Covered: 1_

<details>
<summary> Supporting Image </summary>
<img src="docs/features/feature-slogan.png">
</details>

3. Navigation buttons - This was the first major style that I got to enjoy customizing. I changed pretty much all styling of the button to make it fit my design, but kept the structure somewhat close to the original. The structure of each button is `ul > li > div > a` and utilizes both pseudo elements of the `li`. 

<details>
<summary> Supporting Image </summary>
<img src="docs/features/feature-nav-buttons.png">
</details>

- Background image - Background image is a pattern png with no background color, rotated 45 degrees, which has keyframe moving it on both X and Y axes. The background image is contained within it's own `div`, within the header, and is applied using CSS `background-image: url()`. It took a bit of fine tuning to figure out the best speed for the animation, as the original speed was a bit nausea inducing combined with the bounce of the logo and buttons.

<details>
<summary> Supporting Image </summary>
<img src="assets/images/pattern-hexagrams.webp">
</details>

The footer remains the same across all pages, including any layout shifts.

It consists of 4 sections:
1. 'Join Us' section which lists the physical location and operating hours of the venue.

<details>

2. A Google Maps iframe with a pin and the venue name.

3. 'Contact Us' section which holds the venue's social links and phone number. All links open in a new window and activating the phone number redirects to the mobile phone's dial pad.

- Background image which has been applied using CSS, the same way as the header background.

### Header - All pages (excl index.html)

The header of the remaining pages (our-menu, events, faq, and about) is different to the header seen on the landing page.

This header is made up of 3 features:
1. Logo - uses the same design as on Landing page. On click redirects to Landing page.

<details>
<summary> Supporting Image </summary>
<img src="docs/features/feature-logo2.png">
</details>

2. Back button - Initially this was just an anchor which when activated took you to the landing page. After getting some feedback from other students and doing some research I decided to transform it into a button and add an onclick event (`onclick="history.back()`) which gave it the functionality of a browser back button.
- Structured as `button > i + span`. The span allowed me to hide the text on smaller screens.

3. Navigation links:

- On large screens, the navigation links are organized horizontally with the active element highlighted.

<details>
<summary> Supporting Image </summary>
<img src="docs/features/feature-nav-buttons2.png">
</details>

- On mobile and tablets, the navigation links list is hidden and replaced by a burger button which controls the state of the nav list. The expand/collapse function was done with JavaScript event listener which adds a new class to the body when the button is pressed.

### our-menu.html - Our Menu

Our Menu page is made up of 2 features.
1. Drinks menu, consists of 4 sections of which only 3 are visible at one given time. 
    1. Cold drinks and Hot drinks - visible at all times and are made of `ul > li`, with `span` used to contain the prices, which helped with creating the layout.
    2. Cocktail drinks - has two versions, only one of which is visible depending on the device screen size. 
        - Version A is an accordion, available only on mobile and tablets, made using radio inputs and their :checked state which shows or hides the ingredients of the selected item. This helped make the cocktail menu a lot smaller, eliminating the need to scroll through a long list, and generally easier to digest on smaller devices. As this is a less accessible than an unordered list I decided to hide it from screen readers using `aria-hidden="true"`.
        - Version B is an unordered list made to look like a table. The structure of this version is `ul > li > h4 + 2*span`.

2. Food menu, consists of 2 sections - snacks ("Peckish?...") and meals ("...Hungry?").

### events.html - Events

Events page is made up of 3 features.
1. Carousel -  consisting of 5 images intended to promote the events at the bar. To make it so the images can be focused `tabindex="0"` was added to each img container.
    - On desktop, the images are spread across the view width.
    - On mobile and tablet, utilizes `flex-shrink: 1` which forces the images to fit to the container width, creating an overflow on the X axis, which we then use to our advantage by adding `overflow-x: scroll`, allowing us to scroll through that overflow.

_User Story Covered: 2, 15_

2. Sign Up form - consists of a trigger button and a form with multiple inputs, the form's visibility is controlled the same as the mobile nav burger menu. This was fairly challenging as I had no point of reference, so I had to logic my way into making the form behave the way I had envisioned. Possibly my favorite feature on the website.

3. Event lists - two unordered lists, styled identically. The dark background of each item was added to improve contrast/accessibility and make it stand out. The list items have a :hover style to make them look like links.

</details>

_User Story Covered: 12, 13_

### faq.html - FAQ

FAQ page consists of 2 features.
1. Frequently Asked Questions search and scroll - consists of two parts.
- Search:
    - a search input field, which currently does not have functionality much different to a text input element.
    - a search button, visually nested within the search input field.

<details>
<summary> Supporting Image </summary>
<img src="docs/features/feature-search-bar.png">
</details>

- Scroll box with questions and answers - used the same method to create the scroll behavior as the image carousel on Events page, with customized scroll bar to match the website theme. It was with this feature that I learned of the existence of `scroll-padding`, which helped me control the exact position the scroll snapped to, so the bottom of the previous div is always visible. `tabindex="0"` was also added to each container to make each FAQ entry in the scroll box focusable.

<details>
<summary> Supporting Image </summary>

</details>

_User Story Covered: 1, 2, 16, 18_

2. Feedback Form - a standard form with a custom appearance. I reset the radio element appearance using `appearance: none` and then rebuilt them from scratch in order to give them the appearance resembling LED lights of a computer.

_User Story Covered: 10, 20_

### about.html - About Us

About Us page consists of 2 features:
1. Bar Perks - a section outlining the perks of visiting the bar. This feature has 3 layout shifts for each device. This was also the point at which I researched direct text manipulation a bit deeper and found `writing-mode` (more widely used in Eastern countries such as Japan, where text is written top-to-bottom, left-to-right), which helped me with fitting everything on smaller devices. The dark gradient was added to make the section stand out and improve text visibility.

<details>
<summary> Supporting Image </summary>
<img src="docs/features/feature-perks.png">
</details>

_User Story Covered: 1, 2, 18_

2. Comment Section - this section shows comments left by previous customers of the bar. Each comment consists of a heading, containing the comment, and a paragraph element housing the comment author.

<summary> Supporting Image </summary>

### 404.html

Custom 404 Page Not Found error page gives helpful instructions to the customer should they find themselves on a broken link/missing page.

The button on the page takes the user to the landing page (index.html), or they can use the back button and/or navigation links to get back.

## 5. Testing

### HTML Validation 

[W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML of the website. All pages pass with 0 errors and 0 warnings.

### Accessibility

[WAVE WebAIM Web Accessibility (Chrome Plugin)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) was used to check that the code meets accessibility standards. 

Menu, Events and FAQ pages pass with 0 errors and 0 warnings.

Landing page has 4 alerts for "device dependent event handler" (onclick). As the button consists of a styled `li` with an anchor descendant I wanted to make sure the styled element acts as a button, which is where the onclick property came in handy.

About Us page has 3 alerts for "Possible heading" due to content length. Alerts pertain to the use of `<p>` element as text container for the comments section author found under the white bubble.

## 6. Bug/Fix Log

| ID | Bug | Fix
|--- |--- |---
| 1 | On pages with less content footer ends up positioned mid-page. | Set `min-height` of body to 100vh.
| 2 | Landing page background animation ends with the background out of view. | Change X and Y values of `translate3d()` property to 66% at the end of the animation.
| 3 | JavaScript throws a TypeError on pages where the `.signup-form--toggle` button does not exist. | Nest the function which adds the event listener within an if statement which checks if the button exists.
| 4 | Unable to tab through each FAQ entry in scroll box (faq.html) | Add `tabindex="0"` to each entry.
| 5 | Logo is not redirecting users to landing page, shows caret pointer | An `all: unset` property causes the natural behavior of an anchor element to disappear. Remove property and style individually. 
| 6 | Sign-up form `box-shadow` creates shadow on top of gradient instead of under. | Move `box-shadow` property to sign up form's `::before` pseudo element.
