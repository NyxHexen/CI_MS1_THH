## Introduction, Inception & Purpose

### __*The Bar*__
An all-inclusive community-oriented gaming bar in Cardiff, where people can play video games while enjoying drinks & food. Events are hosted regularly where customers are invited to participate in competitive video games, along regular events such as hosting meet-ups, brand parties, product launches, etc.

### __*The Website*__
For The Hexen Hut, I wanted to create something that does not necessarily conform to the more mainstream layouts and styles used, while staying true to the principles of UXD in keeping the website intuitive, simple and enjoyable to use.

### **Strategy**

1. Is the content culturaly appropriate?
    - The content is primarily targeted towards gamers of any background or preference.

2. Is the content relevant?
    -   Easy to understand articles with no walls of text.
    -   Content is appropriate for non-tech savvy customers as well.
    -   Links & buttons invite the customer to explore further.

3. Is the technology appropriate?
    -   The site is written in HTML and CSS, and some Bootstrap elements which assist in creating a mobile-first layout. The site will be developed as minimum viable product. Future releases will introduce additional features and functionality to enhance the user experience further.

## 8. Issues & Change Log
| ID |Description |Status |
|---|---|---|
|0 | Writing this README is much bigger of a challenge than initially perceived. | Panicked - Ongoing|
|1 | README file - Website Architecture image top whitespace. | Fixed |
|2 | After scouring the internet for potential content (text) to include I came to the conclusion that my initial idea of a coders + gaming bar is a bit too specific as they generally have different goal. As I am not much of a content author (for now) I have done a quick pivot towards having the bar be gaming only. |N/A|
