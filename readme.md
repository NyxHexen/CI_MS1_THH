### *Project Requirements:*git 
- Custom HTML5 and CSS3 code to create at least 3 pages, or 3 separate page areas.

-   The content is primarily targeted towards gamers of any background or preference.
-   Easy to understand sections with no walls of text.
-   Content is appropriate for non-tech savvy customers as well.
-   Links & buttons invite the customer to explore further.
-   The website should elicit a positive response and make the customer excited to visit in person.

## 8. Issues & Change Log
| ID |Description |Status |
|---|---|---|
|0 | Writing this README is bigger of a challenge than initially perceived. | Panicked - Ongoing|
|1 | README file - Website Architecture image top whitespace. | Fixed |
|2 | After scouring the internet for potential content (text) to include I came to the conclusion that my initial idea of a coders + gaming bar is a bit too specific as they generally have different goal. As I am not much of a content author (for now) I have done a quick pivot towards having the bar be gaming only. |N/A|
