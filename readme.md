## 2. User Experience
[`Back To Top`](#table-of-contents)

The website has been designed as mobile-first, and has 3 general layout shifts for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

I wanted to keep the design minimalistic, and content to the point, but add extra functionality where possible to enhance the overal experience.

### **Target Audience**
The bar's primary demographic is people interested in video games and e-sports.

### **User Stories**
1. As a new customer I would like to learn about The Hexen Hut and what it is.
2. As a new customer I would like to know where the bar is located.
3. As a new/returning customer I would like to read about what other people's experience visiting the bar is.
4. As a new/returning customer I would like to see what food & drinks the bar offers.
5. As a new/returning customer I would like to find out more about the events held at the bar.
6. As a new/returning customer I would like to sign-up for an upcoming event.
7. As a new/returning customer I am looking to visit their social media accounts to stay updated.
8. As a new/returning customer I am looking to contact the bar with a question/suggestion.

### **Scope**

#### The scope of the project at release is defined as below:
- A full-screen landing page.
- Navigation links/bar to allow users to explore the website. Link/button highlighted when active.
- Footer with bar address, opening times and social links.

## Design

My idea for the design was to create something that resembled video games in the 80's while keeping the styling smooth, with a 3D feel.

### **Color Scheme**
Initially, primary and accent were swapped, but after applying some of the styling I decided the green is better suited as primary.

Primary Color: <span style="background-color: #9dff00; color: black">#9dff00</span>

Accent Color: <span style="background-color: #7738ff; color: white">#7738ff</span>

Container Color: <span style="background-color: #777; color: white">#7738ff</span>

Background Color: <span style="background-color: #222; color: white">**#222**</span>

### **Typography**
The **fallback font** chosen across the website is 'sans-serif' for it's accessibility.

My **logo and h1-h3 headings** font is Press Start 2P from Google Fonts. I chose this font because it is an 8-bit style, bulky, font which fit into the thematic of the bar.

My **h4+ headings and body** font is Play, also from Google Fonts. The font is more angular which compliments the 8-bit style font.

### **Images**
Images on the website have been sourced through Google Images search and, where available, are licensed for non-commercial use.

## 5. Testing
[`Back To Top`](#table-of-contents)

### HTML Validation 
[W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML of the website. All pages pass with 0 errors and 0 warnings. 

<details>
<summary>Landing Page (index.html)</summary>

<img src="assets/images/">
</details>

<details>
<summary>Our Menu (our-menu.html)</summary>

<img src="assets/images/">
</details>

<details>
<summary>Events (events.html)</summary>

<img src="assets/images/">
</details>

<details>
<summary>FAQ (faq.html)</summary>

<img src="assets/images/">
</details>

<details>
<summary>About Us (about.html)</summary>

<img src="assets/images/">
</details>

### CSS Validation
[W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate the CSS of the website.

Both CSS passed with 0 errors, and warnings relating only to variables.

<details>
<summary>style-main.css (index.html specific)</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>style.css</summary>

</details>

### Accessibility
[WAVE WebAIM Web Accessibility (Chrome Plugin)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) was used to check that the code meets accessibility standards. 

Menu, Events and FAQ pages pass with 0 errors and 0 warnings.

Landing page has 4 alerts for "device dependent event handler" (onclick). As the button consists of a styled div with an anchor child I wanted to make sure the div acts as a button, where the onclick property came in handy.

About page has 3 alerts for "Possible heading" due to content length. Alerts pertain to the use of `<p>` element as text container for the Comments section author found under the white bubble.
