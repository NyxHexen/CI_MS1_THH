## Introduction, Inception & Purpose

> ### The Bar

A one-of-a-kind all-inclusive fantasy-themed computer lab & bar in Cardiff. The bar creates and fills the need for a community-centered computer lab & bar where people can relax, work, or study, while enjoying a coffee, cocktail, and/or finger food. Events are hosted regularly where customers are invited to participate in monthly hackathons & competitive video games, along regular events such as hosting meet-ups and themed nights.

> ### The Website

For The Hexen Hut, I wanted to create something that does not necessarily conform to the more mainstream layouts and styles used, while staying true to the principles of UXD in keeping the website intuitive, simple and enjoyable to use.

1. It's all magic - Using an interactive and responsive design will stand out compared to other venues, provides the member with the wow-factor and encourage them to explore other elements and pages.
2. But also tech - ???
