## 1. Project Goals
[`Back To Top`](#table-of-contents)

The goal of the application is to increase brand awareness in order to promote it and it's events, increase sales, and grow the bar's customer base. The website should be intuitive and elicit a positive response from the visitors.

---

## 2. User Experience
[`Back To Top`](#table-of-contents)

The website has been designed as mobile-first, and has 3 general layout shifts for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

I wanted to keep the design minimalistic, and content to the point, but add extra functionality where possible to enhance the overal experience.

### Target Audience
The bar's primary demographic is people interested in video games and e-sports.

### User Stories
1. As a new customer I would like to learn what The Hexen Hut is and what it offers.
2. As a new customer I would like to know where the bar is located.
3. As a new/returning customer I would like to read about what other people's experience visiting the bar is.
4. As a new/returning customer I would like to see what food & drinks the bar offers.
5. As a new/returning customer I would like to find out more about the events held at the bar.
6. As a new/returning customer I would like to sign-up for an upcoming event.
7. As a new/returning customer I am looking to visit their social media accounts to stay updated.
8. As a new/returning customer I am looking to contact the bar with a question/suggestion.

### Scope

#### The scope of the project at release is defined as below:
- A full-screen landing page.
- Navigation links/bar to allow users to explore the website. Link/button highlighted when active.
- Footer with bar address, opening times and social links.
- Pop-up navigation bar for mobile and tablets.
- Menu page listing all food & drinks available for purchase.
- Interactive accordion listing available cocktails.
- Scroll section showing images from past bar events.
- List of upcoming and past events.
- A pop-up sign-up form, so customers can register to participate in events.
- Search bar (WIP) and a scroll section with frequently asked questions and answers.
- A feedback form for customers to message the bar.
- About page showing bar features and a customer comment section.

### Design

My idea for the design was to create a simple, clean website with an 8-bit feel. Think Square Enix does Minecraft.

#### Colour Scheme

<img src="docs/design/color-palette-thh.png" width="300">

#### Typography
The **fallback font** chosen across the website is 'sans-serif' for it's accessibility.

My **logo and h1-h3 headings** font is Press Start 2P from Google Fonts. I chose this font because it is an 8-bit style, bulky, font which fit into the thematic of the bar.

My **h4+ headings and body** font is Play, also from Google Fonts. The font is more angular which compliments the 8-bit style font.

#### Images
Images across the website are sourced through Unsplash and a couple of Google searches. The sources have been listed below.

## 3. Features
[`Back To Top`](#table-of-contents)

The website consists of 5 fully responsive pages with 12 features across.

Each page has 2-3 layout shifts across the 3 types of devices.

### Features at release

### index.html - Landing Page

Landing page has it's own separate stylesheet as the page consists of only header and footer elements. While footer remains the same across all devices, I wanted to house this header style separate from the rest.

I kept the landing page as simple and as clean as possible, so the customer gets a feel for what the website is about. This is the only page where the slogan can be found as it's one of only 3 things the customer sees upon visiting and it describes what the venue is about. A gaming bar.

The landing page consists of 2 main features:
1. Full screen header.
2. Footer.

The full screen header consists of 3 sections:
1. Logo - I wanted to keep things simple, so the logo is made up of an anchor (to allow use as navigation button) within an h1 element. The `h1` allowed the logo to also naturally respond to any view width changes. The logo has an infinite bounce keyframes animation inspired by the behaviour of the game title in some video games. When clicked sends you to the landing page.
2. Slogan - A standard `h2`, describing the bar's theme and purpose. It took a bit of time to style it the way it looks now. I wanted it to stand out, which is why I chose the color black for the text, but that created some issue with readability and contrast which I resolved by adding two layers of shadow in different color.
3. Navigation buttons - This was the first major style that I got to enjoy customising. I changed pretty much all styling of the button to make it fit my design, but kept the structure somewhat close to the original. The structure of each button is `ul > li > div > a` and utilises both pseudo elements of the `li`. 

- Background image - Background image is a pattern png with no background color, rotated 45 degrees, which has keyframes moving it on both X and Y axes. The background image is contained within it's own `div`, within the header, and is applied using CSS `background-image: url()`. It took a bit of fine tuning to figure out the best speed for the animation, as the original speed was a bit nausea inducing combined with the bounce of the logo and buttons.

The footer remains the same across all pages, including any layout shifts.

It consists of 4 sections:
1. 'Join Us' section which lists the physical location and operating hours of the venue.
2. A Google Maps iframe with a pin and the venue name.
3. 'Contact Us' section which holds the venue's social links and phone number. All links open in a new window and activating the phone number redirects to the mobile phone's dial pad.

- Background image which has been applied using CSS, the same way as the header background.

### Header - All pages (excl index.html)

The header of the remaining pages (our-menu, events, faq, and about) is different to the header seen on the landing page.

This header is made up of 3 features:
1. Logo - uses the same design as on Landing page. On click redirects to Landing page.
2. Back button - Initially this was just an anchor which when activated took you to the landing page. After getting some feedback from other students and doing some research I decided to transform it into a button and add an onclick event (`onclick="history.back()`) which gave it the functionality of a browser back button.
    - Structured as `button > i + span`. The span allowed me to hide the text on smaller screens.
3. Navigation links:
    - On large screens, the navigation links are organised horizontally with the active element highlighted.
    - On mobile and tablets, the navigation links list is hidden and replaced by a burger button which controls the state of the nav list. The expand/collapse function was done with JavaScript event listener which adds a new class to the body when the button is pressed.

### our-menu.html - Our Menu

Our Menu page is made up of 2 features.
1. Drinks menu, consists of 4 sections of which only 3 are visible at one given time. 
    1. Cold drinks and Hot drinks - visible at all times and are made of `ul > li`, with `span` used to contain the prices, which helped with creating the layout.
    2. Cocktail drinks - has two versions, only one of which is visible depending on the device screen size. 
        - Version A is an accordion, available only on mobile and tablets, made using radio inputs and their :checked state which shows or hides the ingredients of the selected item. This helped make the cocktail menu a lot smaller, eliminating the need to scroll through a long list, and generally easier to digest on smaller devices. As this is a less accessible than an unordered list I decided to hide it from screen readers using `aria-hidden="true"`.
        - Version B is an unordered list made to look like a table. The structure of this version is `ul > li > h4 + 2*span`. 
2. Food menu, consists of 2 sections - snacks ("Peckish?...") and meals ("...Hungry?").

### events.html - Events

Events page is made up of 3 features.
1. Carousel -  consisting of 5 images intended to promote the events at the bar. To make it so the images can be focused `tabindex="0"` was added to each img container.
    - On desktop, the images are spread across the view width.
    - On mobile and tablet, utilises `flex-shrink: 1` which forces the images to fit to the container width, creating an overflow on the X axis, which we then use to our advantage by adding `overflow-x:scroll`, allowing us to scroll through that overflow.
2. Sign Up form - consists of a trigger button and a form with multiple inputs, the form's visibility is controlled the same as the mobile nav burger menu. This was fairly challenging as I had no point of reference, so I had to logic my way into making the form behave the way I had envisioned. Possibly my favourite feature on the website. 
3. Event lists - two unordered lists, styled identically. The dark background of each item was added to improve contrast/accessibility and make it stand out. The list items have a :hover style to make them look like links.

### faq.html - FAQ

FAQ page consists of 2 features.
1. Frequently Asked Questions search and scroll - consists of two parts.
    1. Search:
        - a search input field, which currently does not have functionality much different to a text input element.
        - a search button, visually nested within the search input field.
    2. Scroll box with questions and answers - used the same method to create the scroll behaviour as the image carousel on Events page, with customised scroll bar to match the website theme. It was with this feature that I learned of the existence of `scroll-padding`, which helped me control the exact position the scroll snapped to, so the bottom of the previous div is always visible. `tabindex="0"` was also added to each container to make each FAQ entry in the scroll box focusable.
2. Feedback Form - a standard form with a custom appearance. I reset the radio element appearance using `appearance: none` and then rebuilt them from scratch in order to give them the appearance resembling LED lights of a computer.

### about.html - About Us

About Us page consists of 2 features.
1. Bar Perks - a section outlining the perks of visiting the bar. This feature has 3 layout shifts for each device. This was also the point at which I researched direct text manipulation a bit deeper and found `writing-mode` (more widely used in Eastern countries such as Japan, where text is written top-to-bottom, left-to-right), which helped me with fitting everything on smaller devices. The dark gradient was added to make the section stand out and improve text visibility.
2. Comment Section - this section shows comments left by previous customers of the bar. Each comment consists of a heading, containing the comment, and a paragraph element housing the comment author.

### Accessibility
[WAVE WebAIM Web Accessibility (Chrome Plugin)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) was used to check that the code meets accessibility standards. 

Menu, Events and FAQ pages pass with 0 errors and 0 warnings.

Landing page has 4 alerts for "device dependent event handler" (onclick). As the button consists of a styled div with an anchor child I wanted to make sure the div acts as a button, where the onclick property came in handy.

About page has 3 alerts for "Possible heading" due to content length. Alerts pertain to the use of `<p>` element as text container for the comments section author found under the white bubble.

### Performance
[Google Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) was used to measure the website's speed and performance.
